This repository was used for the MSc thesis of Fabian Ballast named:

"Robust Control of Large-Scale Satellite Constellations Using System-Level Synthesis"


The setup is as follows:

    - Data: Store random data samples.
    - DataProcessing: Process the data.
    - Plots: Random plot scripts
    - Results: Contains scripts to create, store and plot results
    - Setup: Contains 90% of the actual code.
    - SLS: The original Python SLS repository.
    - Symbolics: For playing with Symbolic toolbox.
    - Tests: Test scripts to run the code.
    - tudatpy-examples: Examples from the tudatpy repository.

The required software is shown in 'requirements.txt'. 


The setup folder contains the following structure:

    - Controllers: Different controllers to use.
    - Dynamics: Different dynamical models to use.
    - Filters: Experiment with Kalman filter.
    - FormationDesign: Planning the starting formation.
    - Optimisation: Everything related to the optimisation problems.
    - Robust: Evertything related to robust control.
    - Scenarios: Each scenario determines the different parameters. 
    - Simulator: The simulator that is used.
    - Space: Link between the simulation and the controllers.
    - Utils: Utilisation functions.
    - Visualisation: Plotting scripts

Good luck!
